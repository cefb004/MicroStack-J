# MicroStack-J

MicroStack-J is a Full Stack Java application designed to demonstrate a complete microservices-based architecture using modern open-source technologies.

üöÄ Overview

This project serves as an educational and practical example of how to build, deploy, and scale a distributed system using Java (Spring Boot), Angular, and a set of supporting tools for service discovery, messaging, monitoring, and CI/CD.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture

1) Frontend: Angular (UI for interaction with REST APIs).

2) API Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway / NGINX (routing and load balancing).

3) Microservices: Independent Spring Boot services (e.g., Users, Games, Rentals, Payments), each with its own database.

4) Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB (polyglot persistence).

5) Service Discovery: Netflix Eureka / HashiCorp Consul.

6) Messaging: Apache Kafka / RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.

7) Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus + Grafana, ELK Stack.

8) CI/CD: GitHub Actions / Jenkins for automation.

9) Containerization & Orchestration: Docker + Kubernetes (Minikube or K3s for local deployment).

üéØ Goals

- Learn and practice Full Stack Java development.

- Understand the principles of microservices architecture.

- Gain hands-on experience with cloud-native open-source tools.

- Provide a solid foundation for scaling from a monolithic MVP to a distributed system.

üìå Status

Currently under active development as a study project. The main objective is to build a functioning MVP and then iteratively expand into a fully distributed architecture.
